# Lessons Learned for Claude Sessions

1. STOP AND READ FIRST
   - Before any actions, thoroughly read all provided documents
   - The instructions are there to prevent wasting time
   - Don't try to reinvent patterns that are already documented

2. When Stuck
   - Don't keep repeating the same failed pattern
   - Go back to the documentation 
   - Look for the exact pattern needed
   - Ask for help identifying the correct pattern rather than making repeated attempts

3. Time Management
   - Claude sessions are time-limited
   - Avoid wasting time with trial and error
   - Use documented patterns exactly as shown
   - If something isn't working, ask for the correct pattern instead of experimenting

4. Documentation Updates
   - When learning new patterns, document them immediately
   - Include specific examples of what worked
   - Note common pitfalls to avoid
   - Keep documentation current and relevant

Remember: Every minute spent experimenting with patterns that are already documented is a minute wasted from the limited session time.
