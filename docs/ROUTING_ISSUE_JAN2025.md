# Routing Issue Investigation - January 2025

## Issue Description
Users are unable to access component routes, specifically:
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/admin
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/game

Behavior: Site redirects to base URL showing only background image.

## Initial Investigation (January 4, 2025)

### Components Found:
1. Routing configuration exists in app-routing.module.ts
2. Firebase hosting configured in firebase.json
3. Main app module has component declarations

### Potential Issues Identified:
1. App module may not be properly bootstrapping components
2. Missing base href configuration
3. Firebase hosting might not be properly configured for SPA routing
4. Component loading issue in the main AppComponent

## Investigation Steps:

1. **Router Configuration Check**
   - Routes are defined in app-routing.module.ts
   - Admin route is lazy-loaded
   - Game component is directly loaded

2. **Firebase Configuration Review**
   - Hosting rewrites are present in firebase.json
   - CORS and cache headers are configured

3. **Component Structure**
   - App module imports necessary modules
   - Firebase initialization present

## Next Steps for Resolution:

1. Check AppComponent template for proper router-outlet
2. Verify index.html has correct base href
3. Investigate component loading sequence
4. Review build configuration

## Updates will be added as investigation progresses...
