# Routing Issue Investigation - January 2025

## Issue Description
Users are unable to access component routes, specifically:
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/admin
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/game

Behavior: Site redirects to base URL showing only background image.

## Investigation Findings (January 4, 2025)

### Project Structure:
- Using Nx workspace (not standard Angular)
- Build configuration in project.json (not angular.json)
- Firebase hosting configured for SPA

### Issues Identified:

1. **Build Configuration**:
   - Build output might not include proper routing handling for SPA
   - Need to verify project.json configurations

2. **Routing Configuration Conflict**:
   - Duplicate base href tags in index.html
   - Multiple routing configurations might conflict

3. **Firebase Deployment**:
   - Current Firebase hosting config might need updates for SPA routing
   - Need to verify rewrite rules

## Fixes Applied:

1. **Index.html Cleanup**:
   - Removed duplicate base href tag
   - Reorganized meta tags
   - Added error handling to version check script

2. **App Component Updates**:
   - Improved auth state management
   - Added error boundaries
   - Updated template structure

## Next Steps:

1. **Build Verification**
   - Review project.json build configuration
   - Ensure all necessary files are included in the build
   - Verify production configuration

2. **Firebase Config Check**
   - Review firebase.json rewrite rules
   - Verify hosting configuration
   - Check for any caching issues

3. **Testing Plan**
   - Test locally with nx serve
   - Test production build locally
   - Deploy and verify routes

## Current Status:
- Initial fixes applied to index.html and app component
- Further investigation needed for build configuration
- Need to verify changes in development environment

## Notes for Team:
- Project uses Nx workspace structure
- Build configuration is in project.json
- Deployment uses Firebase Hosting
- Keep documentation updated with any configuration changes

## To Be Investigated:
1. Verify Firebase Functions if being used
2. Check for any route guards blocking access
3. Review service worker configuration if present
4. Test different deployment configurations
