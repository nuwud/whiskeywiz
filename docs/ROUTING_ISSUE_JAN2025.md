# Routing Issue Investigation - January 2025

## Issue Description
Users are unable to access component routes, specifically:
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/admin
- https://whiskeywiz2.web.app/game

Behavior: Site redirects to base URL showing only background image.

## Investigation Findings (January 4, 2025)

### Issues Identified:

1. **Duplicate Base Href**
   - index.html contains two base href tags
   - This can cause routing conflicts
   - Only one base href should be present

2. **Router Outlet References**
   - Router outlet exists but might not be properly initialized
   - Auth service reference in template might cause early errors

3. **Build Configuration**
   - Need to verify angular.json configuration for proper routing
   - Check if deployments include proper routing configuration

## Immediate Fixes Required:

1. **Index.html Fixes**
   - Remove duplicate base href tag
   - Ensure proper order of meta tags
   - Add proper CSP headers

2. **App Component Fixes**
   - Update auth service reference handling
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Improve component initialization

3. **Build Process Updates**
   - Add proper build configuration for routing
   - Update Firebase deployment settings

## Steps Being Taken:

1. Correcting index.html configuration
2. Updating app component template
3. Adding error handling
4. Reviewing build process

## Progress Updates:

### January 4, 2025 - Initial Investigation
- Identified duplicate base href issue
- Located potential auth service initialization problem
- Found missing error boundaries in app component

### Next Steps:
1. Implement identified fixes
2. Test routing in development environment
3. Deploy changes and verify in production
4. Document any additional issues found

## Notes:
- Keep track of deployment timestamps
- Monitor error logs after changes
- Document any authentication-related issues separately
