# Implementation Notes

## 2024-01-03: Quarter Module Architecture Clarification (Update 8)

### Component Architecture
1. Quarter Component Types:
   - `quarter.component.ts`: Router component for dynamic quarter loading
   - `base-quarter.component.ts`: Base class with common functionality
   - Individual quarter components (0122-1225): Specific implementations

2. Module Organization:
   - QuartersModule: Handles all quarter-related components
   - No need for separate quarter.module.ts
   - All quarters extend BaseQuarterComponent

### Changes Made
1. Updated `quarters.module.ts`:
   - Added all quarter components (0122-1225)
   - Included QuarterComponent
   - Proper module imports and exports

2. Component Roles:
   - QuarterComponent: Dynamic routing/loading
   - BaseQuarterComponent: Shared functionality
   - Individual Quarters: Specific implementations

### Component Flow
1. URL routing (e.g., /game?quarter=1225)
2. QuarterComponent handles route params
3. Loads specific quarter component
4. Quarter uses base functionality

### Testing Notes
Verify:
1. Dynamic quarter loading
2. All quarters properly registered
3. Base functionality inheritance
4. Routing functionality

### Next Steps
1. Update remaining quarter components
2. Test routing functionality
3. Verify dynamic loading
4. Test all quarters
