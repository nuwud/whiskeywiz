2. Removed duplicate routing configurations
3. Added hash-based routing
4. Updated service providers

## Next Focus Areas

### Admin Component Priority
1. Fix admin module loading
2. Ensure proper authentication
3. Configure admin routes

### Quarterly Game Components Priority

2. Ensure proper quarter loading
3. Configure game routes

## Next Steps

## Notes for Team

- Firebase initialization is critical
- Service providers centralized in app.module.ts
- Routes configured in app-routing.module.ts

## Investigation Progress
